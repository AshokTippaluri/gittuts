<!-- The Core Principles of DevOps -->
<!-- DevOps revolves around a set of core principles that guide its implementation and practices. These principles include: -->
1. Collaboration – DevOps encourages open communication and collaboration between development and operations teams, fostering a culture of shared responsibility and accountability.
2. Automation – Automation is a cornerstone of DevOps. It streamlines processes, reduces human error, and allows for faster delivery and improved consistency.
3. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) – CI/CD is the practice of automatically building, testing, and deploying software changes to production. This approach ensures a continuous flow of high-quality software
releases.
4. Feedback and Monitoring – DevOps emphasizes the importance of monitoring and gathering feedback from both technical and business stakeholders to improve processes and continuously iterate on products.
5. Continuous Learning and Improvement – A commitment to continuous learning and improvement is essential in a DevOps culture. Teams should regularly evaluate their processes and tools to identify areas for growth and
optimization.

5. Increased Customer Satisfaction – With faster delivery and higher-quality products, your organization can better meet customer expectations, resulting in increased satisfaction and loyalty.


<!-- Git is not Github.  -->
Git is the version control software, and Github is a git repository hosting service which offers all the source code management provided in git. Github is where you upload your git repository.
<!-- Centralized Version Controlling -->
The systems such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place.
<!-- Distributed Version Controlling -->
In a DVCS (such as Git), clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully mirror the repository,including its full history. Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.
